This is Herbie Hancock's unique copy of a Steinway Grand D-274. It was tailor-made in 1982 for his studio work within his own studio. The key action mechanism is made of a lighter and yet stiffer composit of steel and wood, resulting in a breaktrough regarding key velocity sensitivity at that time.
