## Using Github - a technical documentationoy to netlify

Easily deploy and manage your project work via Github's untouched usability

## What is Git? What is Github?

Git is a version control system that manages and keeps track of your code. GitHub, on the other hand, is a service that let you host, share, and manage your code files on the internet.

GitHub uses Git underneath, and lets you manage your Git repositories or folders easily on its platform.

So Git is the actual version control system and GitHub is the platform where you host your code.

### 1. Install Git

Git comes preinstalled in some Macs and Linux-based systems, but you can always check if you have Git installed in your machine by typing `git version` in your terminal. You can use the Command Prompt to do this.



### 2. Create a Github Account

To create an account on GitHub, you will be asked for some personal information like name, confirm your email, set a username and password, and your account should be set up in minutes.

### 3. Connect your GitHub account to your Git account.

You'll do this from your terminal.

To set your Git username, type this in your terminal:

```javascript

git config --global user.name "John Doe"

```

To confirm that you have set your Git username correctly, type this:

```javascript

git config --global user.name

```
You should have "John Doe" as the output.

To set your Git email, type this in your terminal:

```javascript

git config --global user.email "youremail@gmail.com"

```
To confirm that you have set your Git email correctly, type this:

```javascript

git config --global user.email

```
You should have "youremail@gmail.com" as the output.

You will be asked to authenticate your GitHub account, so just sign in with the same email to confirm.

### 4. Create and edit your code files locally

### 5. Create and edit your code files locally


Click the + sign at the top right corner to create a new repository. Repositories are like your code folders online.

Followingly, you will be prompted to this page:

![Editing code locally](/src/assets/github_article_step5_1.png)

Name your repository and give it a description (this is optional).

Click the "Create repository" button to create the repository. You will be prompted to this page:

### 6. Push your local code to GitHub
You can use the code editor built-in terminal to use Git to push your code to GitHub. Click `ctrl` + `shift` + `'` to open the terminal in VSCode. Input the commands below one after the other in your terminal. Press the `Enter` key to proceed after every input.

![Editing code locally](/src/assets/github_article_step6_2.png)

`echo "# sample-code" >> README.md`

`git init`

`git add .`

`git commit -m "first commit"`

`git branch -M main`

`git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/sample-code.git`

`git push -u origin main`

Note that we have `git add README.md` in the repository on GitHub. But here we have used `git add .`, which allows Git to add all other code files except of the `README.md` file.  This `README.md` file will be created by `echo "# sample-code" >> README.md`. Therefore, if you have created any files in your local folder, you need to use `git add .` to add all these files.

Take note that `git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/sample-code.git` will contain the link to your own repository and it will have have the name of your GitHub account.



## Common Git commands to know

Among hundreds of Git commands we can use in the terminal, focusing on some of the most popular ones is a good start.

Here they are:

`git init` lets us initialize Git in our folder.

`git add Readme.md` lets us add the Readme file, while `git add .` lets us add all files in the present folder.

`git commit` stores the added files. Using `-m` for the commit message text, followed by the actual message.

`git branch` creates a new branch which is a new version of a repository. `-M` to move the name to `main`.

`git remote add origin` finally connects our local folder to the repository on GitHub. It is followed by the repository's link.

`git push -u origin main` pushes the code to GitHub. The `-u` flag creates a tracking reference for the branch, and `origin main` puts the code in the main branch.
